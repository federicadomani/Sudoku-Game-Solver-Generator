The Sudoku generation algorithm used by this app is my ultimate proud. Primarily it was based on a Deep Neural Network. But I analyzed more than 100 scientific publications on Sudoku generation problem and have reduced the Deep Neural Network to a relatively simple and very elegant deterministic algorithm that works pretty fast. As a result, the app can generate Sudoku fields in 7 difficulty levels from 'Yellow Belt' to 'Sudoku Game Jedi Master'.

The application supports Quick Start mode for impatient people, see features below [QS Step 1] and [QS Step 2] (buttons in an application window).
